## Identify the Jira

Presumably there is a Jira for the work that caused a new package to be created. 

## Create a workspace of hostos\-upgrade\-payloads

The file that you must modify is located in the hostos\-upgrade\-payloads repository.  Create a workspace as follows:

$ git clone [git@github.ibm.com](mailto:git@github.ibm.com):cloudlab/hostos\-upgrade\-payloads.git \<jira\_identifier\>

## Modify the appropriate manifest and run a test build

There are three manifests in the hostos\-upgrade\-payloads/manifests directory:  base\-os\-sw.yml, base\-net.sw.yml, nextgen\-os\-sw.yml. You should modify the nextgen\-os\-sw.yml file. Make sure that the version you enter is the correct one for the architecture. 

The following is a sample entry, and the amd64 and ppc64el lines are what you replace with a more recent version.



**Sample manifest entry** Expand source



```
- name: cld-blockagent-cli

   file_location: <genctl-artifactory>/storage/block-agent

   personalities:

   - compute

   - control

   - master

   arch_versions:

      amd64: 1.0-1~20200414.0700

      ppc64el: 1.0-1~20200414.0700
```


  


  


Run a build by returning to the top of the workspace and running the following command:

$ make all

**Note** that the ARTIFACTORY\_ACCESS\_TOKEN and ARTIFACTORY\_LOGIN environment variables must be set for the build to run.  For example:

**$** export **ART****IFACTORY\_ACCESS\_TOKEN**\=\<artifactory\_key\>;export **ART****IFACTORY\_LOGIN**\=nolan.ring@[ibm.com](http://ibm.com)

## Create a branch and a Pull Request

After your build has completed successfully, create a branch from the workspace you made your changes in. 

$ git checkout \-b \<jira\_number\>

Commit your changes to the branch and create a PR to get these changes merged into master, assigning someone on the hostOS team as a reviewer.
