## About

The VPC NextGen Host OS is an IBM customized Canonical-built Ubuntu LTS-based Linux
operating system used as the base OS underneath the mzone nodes in our
next-generation hardware fleet. The nodes are primarily hypervisor nodes
on which VSIs run; we call these compute nodes. The Host OS also operates
the other mzone node types—edge, master, and control nodes—whose software
stack designs and threat models are covered via other VPC NG security review materials.
