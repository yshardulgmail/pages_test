title: Critical Security Control Failure Monitoring Policies 
parent: Compliance

## Procedure Overview

  


Different tools are used to  for monitoring and restoring critical systems and security controls when they fail. While these toolings are maintained by service teams, HostOS team does have process which identifies failures.  

 different processes and tools used for documenting the

* cause of failure
* duration of the failure
* details of the remediation to address the root cause to prevent this happening in the future

## Procedure details



| Control | Tool used | Procedure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Network Security | IPtables | We have Quarterly Network Policy review which is used to identify any changes in the network  policies (what is allowed and what isn't). These are documented and tracked through Jira tickets  [Iptables rules validation\- HostOS Mzone nodes](Iptables-rules-validation--HostOS-Mzone-nodes_380538655.html). Currently changes in iptables are monitored at real time through LogDNA alert sent to slack channel. On top of that we also have secondary control with custom monitoring tool which identifies iptable changes and send it to logDNA. |
| File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) | Uptycs | Uptycs agent is installed on  HostOS  nodes through hostos release. FIM is integrated with QRadar. SOC team actively monitors the events generated by the Uptycs and notifies service team for detected high severity security alerts. Service team actively pulls the latest FIM reports  and verifes if all HostOS nodes are compliant. When control failures happen, the service team would create SOS ServiceNow tickets, add collected logs and ask SOS team for assistance |
| Patching and Health Checks | 1\. Nessus / Tenable | Nessus agent is installed on HostOS  nodes using HostOS release bundle. for patching and health checks) scans results are available via SOS Compliance Dashboard reports. HostOS team actively pulls the latest Health Check and Patching reports from  and identifies the failed checks and missing patches.Security team has automation which creates Jira tickets for any failure. if nessus agent fails to report status of node, automated Jira ticket is created in real time for that and hostos team gets notified. |
| Anti\-malware | Uptycs | Uptycs agent is installed on IKS worker nodes through Csutil. SOC team actively monitors the events generated by the Uptycs and notifies service team for detected high severity security alerts. Service team actively pulls the latest EDR reports and verify if all HOStOS nodes are compliant. When control failures happen, the service team would create SOS ServiceNow tickets. |
| Audit Logging Mechanisms | LogDNA, Rsyslog, Qradar | Audit logs are streamed into QRadar from the HostOS nodes. SOC team anaylyzes the logs and alerts the service team for any violations. The service team reviews SOS Compliance dashboard regularly to ensure all devices are logging to QRadar. For identified issue(s) a SOS ServiceNow ticcket is created and SOS team will be notified to identify the cause of failure and share the details of remediation through to resolution. |
| Authentication and Authorization | Accesshub, Softlayer,Teleport bastion Global Protect VPN, Yubikey | The HostOS node access requires Accesshub access, Softlayer access, Teleport bastion host and Global Protect VPN (GPVPN) access. Both bastion and GPVPN access are multifactored and logged. YubiKey is the only approved MFA method for bastion host and GPVPN. AccessHub and Softlayer are used for granting privilege access to IKS worker nodes. In the event of Softlayer or bastion failure, a JIRA ticket will be created and details will be documented . |
| Segmentation controls | \- | This is covered by the bi\-annual VPC Segmentation Testing |
| Security Testing tools | \- | This is control is "NA" as no Automated Security Testing tool is implemented within Service |
