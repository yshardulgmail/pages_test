## FIM System and Control Agent failures

Uptycs agent is installed on all VPC HostOS installed VPC nodes.

FIM is integrated with QRadar. SOC team actively monitors the events
generated by the Uptycs and notifies service team for detected high severity
security alerts. Upon notification by the SOC team, VPC creates a JIRA issue for tracking
the incident response(s) and remediation activities. Any identified incidents are addressed
as per the SLA. HostOS team monitors SOS Compliance dashboard regularly to identify any
FIM agent issue on the VPC HostOS nodes identified.
