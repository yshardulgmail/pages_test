The purpose to use Qradar is that to send severs logs to a central place, which is Qradar. Qradar collects log data from hosts. Then performs real\-time analysis of the log data to identify any abnormal activities, easy to examine log data from various hosts and so on .

  


* **The logs of sshd and sudo from /var/log/auth.log :**

Jun 28 09:42:03 dal2\-qz2\-sr2\-rk118\-s18 sshd\[38371]:\<INFO\> \<AUTH\>  Received disconnect from 192\.168\.219\.17 port 40226:11: disconnected by user

Jun 28 09:42:03 dal2\-qz2\-sr2\-rk118\-s18 sshd\[38371]:\<INFO\> \<AUTH\>  Disconnected from user sysop 192\.168\.219\.17 port 40226

Jun 28 09:42:03 dal2\-qz2\-sr2\-rk118\-s18 sshd\[38359]:\<INFO\> \<AUTHPRIV\>  pam\_unix(sshd:session): session closed for user sysop

Jun 28 09:42:03 dal2\-qz2\-sr2\-rk118\-s18 systemd\-logind\[1042]:\<INFO\> \<AUTH\>  Removed session 169\.

Jun 28 09:42:07 dal2\-qz2\-sr2\-rk118\-s18 sudo:\<NOTICE\> \<AUTHPRIV\>      root : TTY\=unknown ; PWD\=/ ; USER\=root ; COMMAND\=/bin/journalctl \-u kubelet \-n 1

Jun 28 09:42:07 dal2\-qz2\-sr2\-rk118\-s18 sudo:\<INFO\> \<AUTHPRIV\>  pam\_unix(sudo:session): session opened for user root by (uid\=0\)

  


* **Redirecting logging to QRadar :**

To send logs to QRadar, add a line to the rules section in the /etc/rsyslog.d/50\-default.conf file. Use the IP address of the QRadar host with default port 514\. To use TCP, prefix the IP with two @ signs (@@) and restart rsyslog service.

**auth,authpriv.\*       @@192\.168\.219\.128:514**

  


* **Check logs are received on QRadar :**

           Since telemetry team owns QRadar, please check with them to get confirmation that logs are received on QRadar side. Few screenshots attached here.
